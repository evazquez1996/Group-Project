  Once upon a time in long long ago, there was a... to be continued .
  One upon a time in a long, long ago was a cat and a dog who hated each other.
  It all started when the dog bit off one of the cat's ears. Ever since then, the cat has yet to find a soul mate
  Until one day the dog came back around with the ear and said "Will you marry me"
  The cat was full of joy and said "abosulely my love"!
  And the lived happily eva after.
